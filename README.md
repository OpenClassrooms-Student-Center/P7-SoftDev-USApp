# gudlift-registration

### Why

This is a proof of concept (POC) project to show a light-weight version of our competition booking platform. The aim is the keep things as light as possible, and use feedback from the users to iterate.

### Getting Started

    This project uses the following technologies:

    * Python v3.x+
    * [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/)
    * [Virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html)


### Installation

    - Clone the repository and create a new virtual (`python -m venv <VENV_FOLDER>`)

    - Make sure the virtual environment you created is active

    - Install the requirements based on the `requirements.txt` file: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

    - Run the application with `python server.py`. The app will start and display in the terminal a link where you can access it (locally) using your browser.

### Current setup

    The app is powered by [JSON files](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/json/json_quick_guide.htm). They live in the `data` folder.
     
    * `competitions.json` - list of competitions
    * `clubs.json` - list of clubs with relevant information. Inspect this file to find email addresses you can use to login.

### Testing

    The project uses [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/). You should also use [coverage](https://coverage.readthedocs.io/) to create a coverage report.
